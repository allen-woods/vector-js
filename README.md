# VectorJS
An implementation of 2D mathematical vectors in JavaScript using Cartesian coordinates.

A vector is defined here as a pair of X and Y coordinates in Cartesian space which has both a magnitude and a direction. VectorJS implements functionality to represent a vector as a 1-dimensional array containing two elements as input for each method.

## Future Implementation
This project may in the future include implementation for 3D vectors.
